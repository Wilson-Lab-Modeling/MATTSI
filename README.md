# MATTSI
##Model for Advanced Thermal Time-Series Inversion


-Input.m file contains all of the file location parameters and commonly changed physical and time parameters for the model.

-The temperature files used in the model need to be a .csv formatted as:

```
       [depth in mm]  [depth in mm]  [depth in mm]  [depth in mm]    ...
          
Date    [Temp in C]    [Temp in C]    [Temp in C]   [Temp in C]      ...

Date    [Temp in C]    [Temp in C]    [Temp in C]   [Temp in C]      ...

Date    [Temp in C]    [Temp in C]    [Temp in C]   [Temp in C]      ...

...        ...            ...            ...           ...           ...
